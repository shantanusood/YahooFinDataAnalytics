Major Issue list:
 > When a trade has exactly same expiry, ticker and buy price, the ID is duplicated and gets overwritten in progress.json
 > Duplicate strikes are not visible on the monitor table (issue with sortVals function in python)

Minor Issue list:
 > Add trade box account should be a drop down
 > Ticker table on monitor screen should not be allowed to close if there still are active trades in that ticker
 > When last trade for a month is closed the gains json doesnt update the unrealized value for that month to 0
 > Use a dynamic grid like ag-grid for percent pnl data display

Styling issues:
 > Have both pages (by strike, by pnl) as dropdown of monitor on top navigation
 > The total collateral by expiry on top of monitor page should be styled better
 > Fix position issue for percent pnl div table

Get it ready for users:

 > Allow users to edit the name of accounts, and by default should be account1, account2, account3
 > Be able to leave account values empty on historic performace add functionality
 > Dont allow more than one entry per day on historic performance add functionality
 > Allow user to edit data on historic performance chart
 > Show color chart for which account belongs to which color
 > Allow sorting on the percent onl grid
 > USer feedback on click of add or close button on the trade add and close pop ups, like say
